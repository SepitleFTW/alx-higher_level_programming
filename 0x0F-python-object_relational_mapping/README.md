Python programming is awesome due to its versatility, simplicity, and extensive library ecosystem, making it a top choice for various applications such as web development, data analysis, and automation. To connect to a MySQL database from a Python script, install the `mysql-connector-python` package via pip, establish a connection using host, username, password, and database details, and create a cursor object for executing queries. SELECTing rows involves executing a SELECT query and fetching the results using `fetchall()`. INSERTing rows entails executing an INSERT query with specified values and committing the transaction. ORM, or Object-Relational Mapping, simplifies database interactions by representing tables as classes and rows as objects. Mapping a Python class to a MySQL table can be achieved using ORM frameworks like SQLAlchemy, defining models with class attributes corresponding to table columns. Finally, creating a Python Virtual Environment can be done using the built-in `venv` module, allowing for isolated environments where packages can be installed and scripts executed independently.
